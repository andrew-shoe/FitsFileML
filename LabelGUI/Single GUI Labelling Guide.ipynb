    "# Preface\n",
    "- The goal of this GUI is to classify individual signals based on their shape\n",
    "- There are 15 categories, each of which will be explained more in depth below\n",
    "- Each folder to label consists of 500 different fits files; labelling should take approximately 10-15 minutes\n",
    "- On the screen, you will be shown two versions of the same files; the top image is what you should be basing the majority of your classification on; the bottom image amplifies the signal (you will see stronger/more signals) and should just be used in the case that you are not sure of how to classify based on the top image\n",
    "- **undo** button does NOT currently work; please donâ€™t use\n",
    "- If you make significant errors, please go into the folder of labels, delete the labels **csv** file and restart (sorry!)\n",
    "- A lot of the classification is based on your own judgement - i.e. a single strong diagonal signal + a very weak straight signal could be classified as either combination or just strong diagonal - don't stress too much"

    "## Instructions\n",
    "1. Git pull the folder label_files (located in bl-interns)\n",
    "2. Select a (or several) folders from label_files to label and remove the file from the folder (git push the changes!)\n",
    "3. Run python fits_single_GUI\\ .py\n",
    "4. Click Load Project\n",
    "5. Navigate into folder containing signals\n",
    "6. Click Choose\n",
    "7. Classify\n",
    "  1. First, is it a narrow or wide signal (or other)?\n",
    "  2. Then classify based on shape\n",
